## 4. Inventory Adjustments

**Definition**: Inventory adjustments are changes made to the stock levels of products. These adjustments can be:
- **Positive Adjustment**: Increasing the inventory level of a product (e.g., receiving new stock).
- **Negative Adjustment**: Decreasing the inventory level of a product (e.g., product sale or loss).

**Examples**:
- **Positive Adjustment**: Adding 100 units of "Organic Dog Food" to the inventory at the "SYD-Warehouse-1."
- **Negative Adjustment**: Removing 50 units of "Cat Toys" from inventory at both "NSW-Warehouse-1" and "BRISBANE-Warehouse-2."

     b. Initiate an inventory adjustment for "Dog Collars" in "NSWWarehouse-1".
     c. Allow the failure to occur and observe the system's response.
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - The system should detect the failure in updating the 3PL system.
     - The rollback mechanism should activate, reverting the change in the internal system.
     - An error log should be generated detailing the failure and rollback action.
     - The inventory levels in both internal and 3PL systems should remain unchanged from their pre-adjustment state.

### Performance Testing
