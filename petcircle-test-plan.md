# Test Plan: Inventory Management Integration

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the new Inventory Management Integration feature, which aims to integrate the company's existing inventory management system with multiple third-party logistics providers (3PLs) for efficient inventory and order fulfillment management.

## 2. Scope
The scope of this test plan includes:
- Integration of the in-house inventory management system with 3PL systems
- Inventory level adjustments across all warehouses
- Audit trail for inventory adjustments
- Communication between internal and external systems via REST APIs

## 3. Test Types

### 3.1 Functional Testing

#### 3.1.1 Positive Scenarios
1. Verify that a customer service agent can successfully make a positive inventory adjustment for a single warehouse.
2. Confirm that a negative inventory adjustment can be made for multiple warehouses simultaneously.
3. Ensure that inventory adjustments are reflected correctly across all 3PL warehouses and internal systems.
4. Validate that the audit trail correctly captures the customer service agent's information for each adjustment.

#### 3.1.2 Negative Scenarios
1. Attempt to make an inventory adjustment with invalid credentials.
2. Try to adjust inventory levels with non-integer values.
3. Test the system's response when attempting to make a negative adjustment that would result in negative inventory.

#### 3.1.3 Edge Cases
1. Test inventory adjustments with very large positive and negative integers.
2. Verify system behavior when adjusting inventory for a product that doesn't exist.
3. Test inventory adjustments when a 3PL warehouse is offline or unreachable.

### 3.2 Integration Testing

1. Verify successful communication between the internal inventory management system and each 3PL's system via REST APIs.
2. Test error handling when a 3PL API returns an error response.
3. Validate that inventory data is consistent across all systems after various types of adjustments.
4. Test the system's ability to handle different data formats or structures from various 3PL APIs.
5. Verify that changes made in 3PL systems are correctly reflected in the internal system.

### 3.3 Performance Testing

1. Load Testing:
   - Simulate multiple concurrent inventory adjustments from different customer service agents.
   - Test the system's ability to handle a high volume of API calls to and from 3PL systems.

2. Stress Testing:
   - Push the system beyond normal operational capacity to identify breaking points.
   - Test system performance when multiple 3PL integrations are experiencing high latency.

3. Response Time Testing:
   - Measure and verify that inventory adjustments are reflected across all systems within acceptable time limits.
   - Test API response times under various load conditions.

### 3.4 Regression Testing

1. Verify that existing inventory management functionalities remain unaffected by the new integration.
2. Ensure that other related systems (e.g., order processing, customer-facing inventory displays) continue to function correctly with the new inventory management process.
3. Test critical user journeys that involve inventory checks or updates to ensure they still work as expected.

### 3.5 Contract Testing

1. Verify that the API contracts between the internal system and 3PL systems are well-defined and adhered to.
2. Test that any changes in API contracts are backward compatible.
3. Ensure that the data structures and types in API requests and responses match the agreed-upon contracts.
4. Validate error responses and edge cases as defined in the API contracts.

### 3.6 Component Testing

1. Test individual components of the inventory management system in isolation:
   - Inventory adjustment module
   - Audit trail component
   - API gateway for 3PL communication
2. Verify that each component correctly handles various input scenarios and produces expected outputs.
3. Test error handling and boundary conditions for each component.
4. Ensure that components can be easily mocked or stubbed for testing purposes.

## 4. Test Environment

- Internal test environment mirroring production setup
- Staging environments for each 3PL integration
- Mock 3PL APIs for isolated testing
- Containerized environments using Docker for consistent testing across different stages

## 5. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 5.1 Entry Criteria
- All test environments are set up and configured
- Test data is prepared and loaded into the systems
- All necessary API documentation and access are available

### 5.2 Exit Criteria
- All test cases have been executed
- Critical and high-priority bugs have been resolved
- Performance metrics meet or exceed specified requirements
- Integration with all 3PL systems is successful and stable

## 6. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. Risk: Data inconsistency between internal and 3PL systems
   Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and data reconciliation processes

2. Risk: Performance degradation due to increased API calls
   Mitigation: Optimize API calls, implement caching where appropriate, and conduct thorough performance testing

3. Risk: Security vulnerabilities in API integrations
   Mitigation: Conduct security testing and implement proper authentication and encryption measures
